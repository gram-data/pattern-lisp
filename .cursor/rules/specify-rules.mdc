# pattern-script Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2025-12-19

## Active Technologies
- Haskell with GHC 9.10.3 (as per existing project setup) + megaparsec (parsing), text (string handling), containers (data structures), mtl (monad transformers), gram (from gram-hs for future serialization), hspec (testing), QuickCheck (property-based testing) (002-core-lisp-evaluator)
- N/A (in-memory evaluation, no persistence required) (002-core-lisp-evaluator)

- Haskell with GHC 9.6.3 (see research.md for version selection rationale) + gram-hs (source repository from GitHub), text, containers, megaparsec, mtl, hspec, QuickCheck (001-pattern-lisp-init)
